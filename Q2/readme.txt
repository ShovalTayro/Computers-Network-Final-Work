How to run Q2:
1. Open a terminal in the folder where the source files are (bd.cpp, edf.cpp sample_input.txt, makefile).
2. In the terminal run the make command
This command will compile the edf.cpp file into an executable file named edf
and the bd.cpp file into an executable file named bd.
3. Now to run with edf algorithm - run the following command:
./edf <buffer_size> <input>
4. And to run with bd algorithm - run the following command:
./bd <buffer_size> <input>

• Instead of <buffer_size> we will enter a number that represents the size of the buffer that we will use.
• Instead of <input> we enter the name of the file we want to read from.

In my example I ran the 2 algorithms with a buffer of size 5 and with the sample_input.txt file.

in my code I use space between every )(
