How to run Q1:
1. Open a terminal in the folder where the source files are located (prefix_table.cpp, prefix_table_opt.cpp, sample_input.txt, makefile).
2. In the terminal run the make command
This command will compile the prefix_table.cpp file into an executable file named prefix_table
and the prefix_table_opt.cpp file to an executable file named prefix_table_opt
3. Now to run the normal case we will run the command:
./prefix_table sample_input.txt
To run the optimal case we will run the command:
./prefix_table_opt sample_input.txt
Instead of sample_input.txt you can insert any Input file that meets the requirements.
